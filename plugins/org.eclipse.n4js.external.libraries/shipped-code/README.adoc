During the maven build, this folder will be populated with npm packages intended to be
bundled with the N4JS IDE. This is done by MWE2 workflow `UpdateShippedCode.mwe2`.

For local testing, workflow `UpdateShippedCode.mwe2` must be run manually before starting
any tests or launching a runtime Eclipse instance.
